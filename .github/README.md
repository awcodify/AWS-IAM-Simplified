## 🎓 Understanding the Philosophy

### Why This System Exists

**Problem:** AI agents (and developers) need consistent context to:
- Maintain code quality
- Follow established patterns
- Update documentation properly
- Avoid adding technical debt

**Solution:** A structured context system that:
- Provides complete project state (`PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md`)
- Defines clear workflows (`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`)
- Specifies technical standards (`copilot-instructions.md`)

### Core Principles

1. **Documentation is Not Optional**
   - Every code change requires doc updates
   - Context files must stay current
   - Future developers need to understand decisions

2. **Quality Over Speed**
   - Follow established patterns
   - Don't add technical debt
   - Maintain 82/100 code quality or improve

3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
   - Simple, readable code preferred
   - Explain complex decisions
   - Document "why" not just "what"
