## üéØ How to Use This System

### For AI Agents (GitHub Copilot, etc.)

**Every time you work on this project:**

```
1. Read AGENT-WORKFLOW.md
   ‚Üì Follow the 4-phase workflow
   
2. Check PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md
   ‚Üì Understand current state
   
3. Reference copilot-instructions.md
   ‚Üì Follow technical guidelines
   
4. Make changes + Update docs
   ‚Üì Both code AND documentation
   
5. Update PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md if significant
   ‚Üì Keep analysis current
```

### For Human Developers

**First time setup:**
1. Read all three files to understand the system
2. Bookmark these files for reference
3. Follow the same workflow as AI agents

**Daily workflow:**
- Follow `AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` for changes
- Reference `copilot-instructions.md` for coding standards
- Update `PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md` after significant changes

## üéì Understanding the Philosophy

### Why This System Exists

**Problem:** AI agents (and developers) need consistent context to:
- Maintain code quality
- Follow established patterns
- Update documentation properly
- Avoid adding technical debt

**Solution:** A structured context system that:
- Provides complete project state (`PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md`)
- Defines clear workflows (`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`)
- Specifies technical standards (`copilot-instructions.md`)

### Core Principles

1. **Documentation is Not Optional**
   - Every code change requires doc updates
   - Context files must stay current
   - Future developers need to understand decisions

2. **Quality Over Speed**
   - Follow established patterns
   - Don't add technical debt
   - Maintain 82/100 code quality or improve

3. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
   - Simple, readable code preferred
   - Explain complex decisions
   - Document "why" not just "what"

---

## üìä Quality Tracking

### Current Project Status

**From PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md:**
- Overall Status: 75% Production-Ready
- Code Quality: 82/100
- Test Coverage: 0% (critical gap)
- Documentation: 90/100
- Type Safety: 95/100 (no `any` usage)

### Key Metrics to Maintain

| Metric | Current | Must Maintain |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Type Safety | No `any` usage | Zero `any` types |
| Code Quality | 82/100 | ‚â•80/100 |
| Documentation | 90/100 | ‚â•85/100 |
| Max File Size | 731 lines | <500 lines |
| Avg Function Size | <50 lines | <50 lines |

## üîÑ Keeping This System Updated

### When to Update These Files

**AGENT-WORKFLOW.md:**
- When adding new workflow patterns
- When common scenarios change
- When quality gates need adjustment

**PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md:**
- After significant refactoring
- When architecture changes
- After resolving technical debt
- When metrics significantly change (¬±5 points)
- After completing Phase 1, 2, or 3 milestones
- Quarterly reviews (minimum every 3 months)
- **Add timeline entry** (don't replace old entries)

**How to update PROJECT-ANALYSIS.md:**
1. Add new timeline entry at the top
2. Increment version number (1.0 ‚Üí 1.1)
3. Update "Executive Summary" with current state
4. Update relevant metric sections
5. Document what changed and what's remaining

**copilot-instructions.md:**
- When tech stack updates (major versions)
- When coding standards change
- When new patterns are established
- When project structure changes
